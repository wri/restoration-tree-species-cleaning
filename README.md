This repository contains R scripts and data for cleaning project report data for TerraFund projects on tree species in TerraMatch, exported on June 3rd, 2024. 

One script is cleaning the tree species data entered by Champions so it can match to the tree species backbone provided by the World Flora Organization (WFO) and the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP)

The other script follows this RPub series (https://rpubs.com/Roeland-KINDT/1134151) published by Roeland Kindt at ICRAF to match the TerraFund tree species data to the two backbones.

For more information on how the WFO.match function and the WorldFlora package work, please see this paper (https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aps3.11388).

For additional context on this exercise, please see the concept note.

The data for the backbones are too large to post on GitHub, so please download them here:
